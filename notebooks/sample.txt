LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs).  

It provides tools for loading, processing, and managing different types of data sources such as text files, PDFs, web pages, and databases.  

Using LangChain's document loaders, we can efficiently fetch data from multiple sources and utilize it for various AI-based tasks.
